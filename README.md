## Course Policy
- I don’t believe in “cheating” when it comes to real world software engineering 
You are encouraged to ask questions in Slack, help each other with solutions, work on the assignment together, make it better 
- While I don’t believe in “cheating” in the traditional sense, there are certainly good solutions and bad solutions 
Asking another student or iOS engineer when you’re stuck, receiving feedback from them about how to solve the problem and then changing your code is a good solution 
- Searching on Google for “how to push a view controller using code” and then researching sample code and making changes to your code based on what you find, is a good solution 
- Finding a sample iOS build code on Github, downloading it, copying the files into your directory and pushing it to your Github after changing the name and Bundle ID, is a bad solution. Please do not do this.
